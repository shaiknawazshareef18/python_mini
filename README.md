# PIMA Indian Diabetes Prediction
## Project Overview
This study uses the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset to predict a woman's likelihood of having diabetes based on diagnostic features. The dataset includes diagnostic measurements, including age, BMI, and glucose levels, for women of Pima Indian descent who are 21 years of age or older. 'Outcome', the goal variable, specifies if the person has diabetes (1) or not (0). Developing a machine learning model that can distinguish between people with and without diabetes is the aim.

#Dataset Details:
- **Name**: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset
- **Number of Records**: 768
- **Target**: `Outcome` (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

### Features:
- **Numerical**: 
  - Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
  - BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
  - BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
  - Age: Age of the individual in years.
  - Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
  - SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
  - Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
