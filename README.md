# PIMA Indian Diabetes Prediction
## Project Overview
This study uses the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset to predict a woman's likelihood of having diabetes based on diagnostic features. The dataset includes diagnostic measurements, including age, BMI, and glucose levels, for women of Pima Indian descent who are 21 years of age or older. 'Outcome', the goal variable, specifies if the person has diabetes (1) or not (0). Developing a machine learning model that can distinguish between people with and without diabetes is the aim.

#Dataset Details:
- **Name**: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset
- **Number of Records**: 768
- **Target**: `Outcome` (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

### Features:
- **Numerical**: 
  - Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
  - BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
  - BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
  - Age: Age of the individual in years.
  - Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
  - SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
  - Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.

    ## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaiknawazshareef18/python_mini

2. Install required libraries:
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   

Usage
1. Dataset: Save the diabetes.csv dataset to your project directory after downloading it, or enter its path in the script. The model is trained and predictions are made using the dataset.

2. Execute the script: Enter the following command in your terminal to begin the analysis and modeling:
    python diabetes_prediction.py
   
The script will:

1. Load the dataset
2. Preprocess and clean the data.
3. Utilize visualizations to do exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4. Create a model for logistic regression.
5. A variety of metrics are used to assess the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Show important visualizations such as correlation heatmaps, box plots, and histograms.

Features
Data Preprocessing:
1. Taking care of missing values
2. Numerical feature scaling with StandardScaler
3. Dividing the data into test and training sets
4. For categorical characteristics, label encoding
   
EDA, or exploratory data analysis:
1. To see feature distributions, use histograms.
2. Using box plots to find outliers
3. Analysis of feature associations using a correlation heatmap

Modeling
1. Using logistic regression to forecast the existence of diabetes
2. Model evaluation using F1-score, recall, precision, accuracy, and confusion matrix

Illustrations:
1. Individual feature distribution histograms
2. Using box plots to identify outliers
3. Investigating feature associations with a correlation heatmap

Example Output:
When the script is executed, you will see:
1. The number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives that the model predicted is displayed in a confusion matrix.
2. An F1-score, recall, and precision classification report.
3. visualizations include a correlation heatmap, box graphs, and histograms.

Future Work:
1. Model Enhancement: To enhance the model's functionality, investigate alternative machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks.
2. Hyperparameter Tuning: To maximize the model's hyperparameters, employ grid search or randomized search.
3. Cross-Validation: To evaluate model stability and prevent overfitting, use k-fold cross-validation.
